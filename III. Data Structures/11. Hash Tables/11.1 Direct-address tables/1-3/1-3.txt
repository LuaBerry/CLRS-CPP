Q1-3. Suggest how to implement a direct-address table in which the keys of stored
elements do not need to be distinct and the elements can have satellite data.
All three dictionary operations (INSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH) should run in O(1) time.
(Donâ€™t forget that DELETE takes as an argument a pointer to an object to be deleted, not a key.)

A. We can use 'chaining' since there's collision - two keys to same spot.
The arrays of doubly linked list can resolve this problem.

INSERT(T, x)
{

    T[x.key].head.prev = x
    x.next = T[x.key].head

    T[x.key].head = n
}

SEARCH(T, x)
{
    return T[x.key].head
}

DELETE(T, x)
{
    x.prev.next = x.next
    x.next.prev = x.prev

    delete x
}
